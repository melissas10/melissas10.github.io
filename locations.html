  <h2> Florida</h2>   
  <p>The one place I have always wanted to vacation to is Florida! I love every single detail about this state which are its weather, attractions, foods and drinks, and people. I have researched this state many times and have enjoyed every single second of this. One of my favorite drinks is orange juice which is extremely popular in Florida. I love their sunny weather and that Florida
  is know to grow the most freshest fruits which I eat every day. </p>
  
  <h2>Italy</h2> 
  <p> I have seen many luminous pictures of Italy and really want to go visit in the future. I am tryig to learn how to speak Italian
  at the moment because I have always wanted to learn how to speak it. It seems that people over their don't have a care in the world and their accents are to die for, in my opinion. In Italy, people have a different life style than normal because they use boats as most of their transportations. The last reason why I am in love with this country is because of their pizza. </p>    
  
  <h2> Spain </h2>   
  <p> The last place I want to travel is Madrid, Spain. It really facinates me how they speak even though its similar to spansih which I know and understand. I also love all its historic attractions and can read about them every single day. I really enjoy 
  looking at the type of culture and enviornment they live in. I would like to live their some day to experience a day in the life in a busy place like Madrid. </p>  
	    
	    <h3> Argentina</h3>
	    <p> Argentina seems like a really great place to live in because it seems like a nice enviornment. I love their soccer team and
	    always choose it on FIFA. The city I want to visit is Buenos Aires. I am in love with the color of their flag and I know their 
	    language but some words are different</p>
